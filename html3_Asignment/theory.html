 canvas and svg tag 

 canvas 
 Purpose: Used to draw graphics on the web page using JavaScript.

How it works: It creates a blank area (canvas), and you use JavaScript to draw shapes, images, charts, animations, etc.

Does not store content as elements — it's like a bitmap (pixel-based).

svg tag 

Purpose: Used to define vector-based graphics like shapes, lines, text, and images.

How it works: You write XML-like code inside the tag to define each graphic.

Each shape is an element in the DOM, meaning it can be styled with CSS or made interactive.
